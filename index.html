          <h2 id="tribute-info">Why Tony Stark is my favorite?</h2>
          <ul id="Content">
            <li id="features">
              <h2>He is unconventional</h2>
              <p>
                Unlike other superheroes, he doesn't hide his identity. He
                revealed himself to the press so that the world knows that he is
                the Iron Man. He does things in his own way, rather than what
                others expect of him.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="features">
              <h2>Outspoken</h2>
              <p>
                Whatever opinion he has of you, he will say right on your face.
                He doesn't care what you feel about it. If there is something
                good in you, he will appreciate it. If there is someting bad, he
                will say right on the spot.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="features">
              <h2>Sense of urgency</h2>
              <p>
                He is a mortal being, and the fear of death was the reason that
                led him to make the Iron Suit. He obsessively upgrades his suit
                from then, so that he can face the problems that was yet to
                come.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="features">
              <h2>Playfulness</h2>
              <p>
                He is full of fun and a man of high spirits. In his every style,
                there is a liveliness. He is not boring.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="features">
              <h2>He is Mechanic</h2>
              <p>
                He haven't got any supernatural powers. His true power lies in
                the hardwork that he does alone in his garage. He creates things
                on his own and keeps himself up to date.

            Hey It's me Anas and this is one of the projects I made for
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a> and for
            my inspiration Tony Stark. This post is heavily inspired by Najib
            from
